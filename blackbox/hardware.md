# August 2026 Development
## 7/22/26
- Uninstalled old fans and fan hub inside case.
  - Replaced with Arctic 140mm Fans, unknowingly buying the wrong size.
  - Opted to stay with larger fans as it would free up space inside PC, potentially allowing better airflow.
  - Temps increased to average of 55* on CPU and 70* on GPU. (Old temps substantially lower)
  - Ordered beQuiet! 120mm fans to replace the Arctic 140mm fan temps.
- Installed PCIE to NVME SSD adapter in 1x1 PCIE slot.
  - Cloned Windows 11 Partitions on Samsung 1TB NVME to SK Hynix 1TB SSD (salvaged from Legion 5) to seperate both Bazzite and Windows 11. (Windows 11 is credited to delete BazziteOS upon Windows updates occasionally.)
- Plugged in Anker 12in1 USB hub to free up USB ports/Ethernet port. (Allows for PC to become more portable.)
## 7/25/26
- Blackbox starts turning off unexpectedly.
  - Issue first began after booting into Windows 11 on newly installed PCIE NVME.
  - Removed external plating of PC case which allowed Blackbox to startup and run more consistently.
  - Kept re-powering PC every time it turned off in order to continue playing Titanfall 2 (lol.)
  - Went from turning off minutes after start up to being able to withstand gaming sessions.
## 7/26/26
- Blackbox unable to turn on properly.
  - Same issue as before except now the PC will not turn on at all.
  - Uninstalled various hardware such as GPU, PCIE NVME, HDDs, nothing changed anything.
  - Left issue to be fixed when I had time.
## 7/29/26
- Blackbox unable to turn on properly (cont.)
  - Spent 4 hours on diagnosing issue. 
  - PC would not turn on unless tilted at 40* angle with MOBO facing ground.
  - Tested applicable hardware with replacements (GPU, PSU) all working replacements replicated same issue.
  - Removed GPU and attempted boot, issue did not occur.
  - Diagnosed MOBO PCIE port was problem.

## 7/30/26
-  Ordered replacement micro-ATX MOBO (MSI B550m Mag Mortar Max, refurbished off eBay.)
## 8/5/26
- MSI B550m arrived, installed halfway without realizing it was missing stand offs for m.2 drives.
  - Also came missing I/O shield and m.2 heatsink.
  - Also slight dent near I/O, can be removed though.
  - Trying to buy a one off eBay from someone with a broken B550m, every other listing online takes too long to arrive.

## 8/6/26
- Organized some cables to prep for AIO install later this week.
  - Going to adjust some more but it looks way better already.

## 8/13/26
- Uninstalled Bazzite NVME drive and 8TB Barracuda HDD, PC booted to Windows after few minutes
  - The new motherboard bios needed to initalize with an OS, so I removed Linux to prevent conflict and it booted properly.

- Blackbox now running again.
